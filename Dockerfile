# JBrowse

#
# This docker file uses multistage builds, where the first stage (named 'build')
# gets lots of prereqs, checks out git repos and runs the setup script. The
# resulting image is over 2GB and can be deleted after building. The second
# stage (called 'production') then copies files from the first stage and
# results in a image that is just over 100MB.
#
# Also, note the change to the initial parent image: there is now a jbrowse-buildenv
# image at docker hub
#
# Finally, a short note about how this JBrowse instance is configured to work:
# This instance is served up by nginx and only the configuration files and 
# javascript files are served from here.  All of the data are stored in an AWS
# S3 bucket.  This separation makes development and production issues easier
# (in my opinion)
